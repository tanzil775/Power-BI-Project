SUMMARY
Detail-oriented and analytical Data Analyst Intern with hands-on experience in data
cleaning and visualization. Proficient in using Power BI for creating insightful
dashboards and reports, MS Excel for data manipulation and analysis, Python libraries
commonly used in data analysis, data cleaning. Pandas provides data structures like
Data Frames for data manipulation and analysis. NumPy supports large, multidimensional
arrays and matrices and contains a collection of mathematical functions
to operate on these arrays.

The Coffee Shop Sales Data Visualization project is a comprehensive analysis and
visualization initiative aimed at understanding the sales performance of a coffee shop
over various time periods and across different locations. This project leverages a
blend of data cleaning, data analysis, and visualization techniques using Power BI to
provide valuable insights into the sales trends and customer behavior.

Project Objectives
• To clean and preprocess raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
• To analyze sales data to uncover key metrics such as total sales, average bill
per person, and average order per person.
• To visualize sales trends across different time frames (months, weeks) and
locations.
• To create interactive dashboards and pivot tables in Power BI for dynamic data
exploration.


Tools and Technologies
• ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Extract data from various sources and
Transform into Power Query Editor for cleaning and management in the end
load data into Data Model.

• Power Query Editor: Built into Power BI, Power Query allows you to extract
data from various sources, clean, transform, and load it into the Power BI
model

• SQL Server: A relational database management system that can store
structured data.
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): A formula language used in Power BI,
Excel, and SQL Server Analysis Services for creating custom calculations and
measures.

• PivotTable: Create PivotTables to analyze and visualize your data model. You
can drag and drop fields from different tables, and the relationships you
defined will ensure the data is correctly aggregated and filtered.

• Power BI Desktop: The primary tool for designing and creating data models
and visualizations. It includes: Data view, Report view and Model view.

• Power BI Service: A cloud-based service where you can publish and share
Power BI reports and dashboards.

Project Outputs
Sales Summary Reports: Detailed reports showcasing total sales, average bill
per person, and average order per person across various dimensions (time,
location, product type).
Interactive Dashboards: Excel-based dashboards with pivot tables and
slicers for user-driven exploration of the sales data.
Visual Insights: Charts and graphs that highlight key trends, such as seasonal
variations in sales and differences in performance between location
